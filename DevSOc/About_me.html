            You Could Say I like Computer Science and Applied Maths, but in another life I am Probably a Club Dj Or a Famous painter or a fashion Stylist/ Designer
            I love Music, I love fashion, I love enjoying life being with people good vibes, nice alcohol and all that stuff. My real passion is art, 
            my real passion is self expression and music as I said. That is the bigger goal, but in order to get there I just need some money, a firm career before I get into 
            what I really like yk, so YEah that's why I chose Maths and Com Sci.
